This is where the the "Blockternship" project submissions live. 

To get started submit an [issue] in this repo. 

Make sure it contains: 
- Relevant info about you: "Hi I'm Blahhh and I'm into bleepedy blop bloop and I am here to talk about blip blop and blam"  
- Contact info (GitHub, Keybase) 
- Your idea, with links to any existing repos or POC that you might have. 
- Your area of expertise or what you're interested in learning. 
- What you think you'll need, whether it's developers or educational material

Next we'll review you're submissions and ask any relevant questions in the thread. 

If it fits our criteria for this hackathon then we'll ask you to create/fork a repo into the Blockternship!
